\section{TRUE OR FALSE}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Hash collision occur when two different keys generate the same hash value and map to the same index in the hash table 
   \item The push() operation for priority queues has a worst time complexity of O(log n).
   \item The load factor of a hash map indicates the number of buckets in the hash table
   \item All trees are graphs but not all graphs are trees
   \item To print what an iterator is pointing to you have to dereference it using the * operator
   \item A heap can be used to sort elements
   \item A heap must always be a full binary tree
   \item The insert method for hash tables has a best time complexity of O(1)
   \item in hash maps, keys do not have to be unique
   \item priority queues allow for random access like vectors
\end{enumerate}
